# travel-album

Exploring concepts learned in the frontendmasters JavaScript and React courses by building
some kind of travel album. The direction is not yet known, and i'll be exploring different
functionality.

To build and run the project locally, you'll need Node.js (at least 14). Navigate to the
root directory of the project and type 'npm install' followed by 'npm run dev' to get a local
server running that will host the app.
